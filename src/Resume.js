                  On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind
                  Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a
                  thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
                  would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn

                  her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village
                  and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a
                  rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
                  way.
